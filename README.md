## Supported Cryptocurrency Exchange Markets

The CCXT library currently supports the following 1 cryptocurrency exchange markets and trading APIs:

The list above is updated frequently, new crypto markets, exchanges, bug fixes, and API endpoints are introduced on a regular basis. See the [Manual](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki) for more details. If you can't find a cryptocurrency exchange in the list above and want it to be added, post a link to it by opening an issue here on GitHub or send us an email.

The library is under [MIT license](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), that means it's absolutely free for any developer to build commercial and opensource software on top of it, but use it at your own risk with no warranties, as is.

---

## Install

The easiest way to install the CCXT library is to use a package manager:

- [ccxt in **NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ccxt) (JavaScript / Node v7.6+)
- [ccxt in **PyPI**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ccxt) (Python 3.5.3+)
- [ccxt in **Packagist/Composer**](https://packagist.org/packages/ccxt/ccxt) (PHP 5.4+)

This library is shipped as an all-in-one module implementation with minimalistic dependencies and requirements:

- [`js/`](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/js/) in JavaScript
- [`python/`](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/python/) in Python (generated from JS)
- [`php/`](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/php/) in PHP (generated from JS)

You can also clone it into your project directory from [ccxt GitHub repository](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt.git
```

### JavaScript (NPM)

JavaScript version of CCXT works in both Node and web browsers. Requires ES6 and `async/await` syntax support (Node 7.6.0+). When compiling with Webpack and Babel, make sure it is [not excluded](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/issues/225#issuecomment-331905178) in your `babel-loader` config.

[ccxt in **NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ccxt)

```shell
npm install ccxt
```

```JavaScript
var ccxt = require ('ccxt')

console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges
```

### JavaScript (for use with the `<script>` tag):

All-in-one browser bundle (dependencies included), served from a CDN of your choice:

* jsDelivr: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ccxt@1.30.51/dist/ccxt.browser.js
* unpkg: https://unpkg.com/ccxt@1.30.51/dist/ccxt.browser.js

CDNs are not updated in real-time and may have delays. Defaulting to the most recent version without specifying the version number is not recommended. Please, keep in mind that we are not responsible for the correct operation of those CDN servers.

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ccxt@1.30.51/dist/ccxt.browser.js"></script>
```

Creates a global `ccxt` object:

```JavaScript
console.log (ccxt.exchanges) // print all available exchanges
```

### Python

[ccxt in **PyPI**](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ccxt)

```shell
pip install ccxt
```

```Python
import ccxt
print(ccxt.exchanges) # print a list of all available exchange classes
```

The library supports concurrent asynchronous mode with asyncio and async/await in Python 3.5.3+

```Python
import ccxt.async_support as ccxt # link against the asynchronous version of ccxt
```

### PHP

[ccxt in PHP with **Packagist/Composer**](https://packagist.org/packages/ccxt/ccxt) (PHP 5.4+)

It requires common PHP modules:

- cURL
- mbstring (using UTF-8 is highly recommended)
- PCRE
- iconv
- gmp (this is a built-in extension as of PHP 7.2+)

```PHP
include "ccxt.php";
var_dump (\ccxt\Exchange::$exchanges); // print a list of all available exchange classes
```

### Docker

You can get CCXT installed in a container along with all the supported languages and dependencies. This may be useful if you want to contribute to CCXT (e.g. run the build scripts and tests — please see the [Contributing](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document for the details on that).

Using `docker-compose` (in the cloned CCXT repository):

```shell
docker-compose run --rm ccxt
```

You don't need the Docker image if you're not going to develop CCXT. If you just want to use CCXT – just install it as a regular package into your project.

## Documentation

Read the [Manual](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki) for more details.

## Usage

### Intro

The CCXT library consists of a public part and a private part. Anyone can use the public part immediately after installation. Public APIs provide unrestricted access to public information for all exchange markets without the need to register a user account or have an API key.

Public APIs include the following:

- market data
- instruments/trading pairs
- price feeds (exchange rates)
- order books
- trade history
- tickers
- OHLC(V) for charting
- other public endpoints

In order to trade with private APIs you need to obtain API keys from an exchange's website. It usually means signing up to the exchange and creating API keys for your account. Some exchanges require personal info or identification. Sometimes verification may be necessary as well. In this case you will need to register yourself, this library will not create accounts or API keys for you. Some exchanges expose API endpoints for registering an account, but most exchanges don't. You will have to sign up and create API keys on their websites.

Private APIs allow the following:

- manage personal account info
- query account balances
- trade by making market and limit orders
- deposit and withdraw fiat and crypto funds
- query personal orders
- get ledger history
- transfer funds between accounts
- use merchant services

This library implements full public and private REST APIs for all exchanges. WebSocket and FIX implementations in JavaScript, PHP, Python are available in [CCXT Pro](https://ccxt.pro), which is a professional addon to CCXT with support for WebSocket streams.

The CCXT library supports both camelcase notation (preferred in JavaScript) and underscore notation (preferred in Python and PHP), therefore all methods can be called in either notation or coding style in any language.

```JavaScript
// both of these notations work in JavaScript/Python/PHP
exchange.methodName ()  // camelcase pseudocode
exchange.method_name () // underscore pseudocode
```

Read the [Manual](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt/wiki) for more details.

### JavaScript

```JavaScript
'use strict';
const ccxt = require ('ccxt');

(async function () {
    let kraken    = new ccxt.kraken ()
    let bitfinex  = new ccxt.bitfinex ({ verbose: true })
    let huobipro  = new ccxt.huobipro ()
    let okcoinusd = new ccxt.okcoinusd ({
        apiKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY',
        secret: 'YOUR_SECRET_PRIVATE_KEY',
    })

    const exchangeId = 'binance'
        , exchangeClass = ccxt[exchangeId]
        , exchange = new exchangeClass ({
            'apiKey': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
            'secret': 'YOUR_SECRET',
            'timeout': 30000,
            'enableRateLimit': true,
        })

    console.log (huobipro.id,  await huobipro.fetchTrades ('ETH/CNY'))

    console.log (okcoinusd.id, await okcoinusd.fetchBalance ())

    // sell 1 BTC/USD for market price, sell a bitcoin for dollars immediately
    console.log (okcoinusd.id, await okcoinusd.createMarketSellOrder ('BTC/USD', 1))

    // buy 1 BTC/USD for $2500, you pay $2500 and receive ฿1 when the order is closed
    console.log (okcoinusd.id, await okcoinusd.createLimitBuyOrder ('BTC/USD', 1, 2500.00))

    // pass/redefine custom exchange-specific order params: type, amount, price or whatever
    // use a custom order type
